- 👋 Hi, I’m @smallmexican
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to program. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, I started learning a little Java, Javascript then started a diploma in computer science. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to expand my knowledge on all platforms and Github was highly recommended. 

I will add to this as I progress and learn more :D
